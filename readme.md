# Local Sharing
Have you ever tried to share a file with family or local devices but failed?

This is the soloution. You can use this even IF you are on windows. You just need python.

## Install
You just need `python3` and `flask` for it. That's it.

## Config
The default config is here:
```yaml
token: "your-secret-token"
uploads_locked: false # Can be true or false
upload_folder: "uploads" # Folder where files will be stored
```
The token is like a password. Other than that, everything else is clear.
